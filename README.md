## Data Modelling Architectures
 + RDBMS
 + Key-value pairs
 + Graph oriented
 + Column oriented
 + NOSQL
### Data complexity contributers
 + Velocity
 + Volume
 + Varsity
 + Variety
 + Transformation
### Data management strategies
 + Data locality
   - Affected nonfunctional requirement is throughput
 + Replication
   - Affected nonfunctional requirement is reliability
 + Sharding and partition
   - Distributing data across multiple different nodes, can improve performance
 + Caching
   - Affected nonfunctional requirement is throughput
 + Normalization and Denormalization

## Data Modelling Methodologies
 + Top-down methodologies
   - Identify attributes and then move down
 + Bottom-up methodologies
   - Identify entities, relation and then the attributes
